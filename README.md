### API Endpoints
While this app currently doesn't utilize a custom backend, it retrieves quiz questions from the Open Trivia Database API. Hereâ€™s the structure:

GET /api/questions: Fetch a set of quiz questions from the Open Trivia Database.
### REST Guidelines
Use appropriate HTTP methods: GET for fetching data; POST for submitting results (future implementation).
URL patterns should be meaningful (e.g., /api/questions).
Return appropriate HTTP status codes: 200 OK for successful requests; 400 Bad Request for invalid inputs; 500 Internal Server Error for server issues.
